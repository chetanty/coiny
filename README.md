# Welcome to Coiny
A project by Chetan Tyagi and David Pham

# Inspiration
The project was inspired by the hobby of coin collecting and was made as a solution to the problem of identifying coins, both local and international.

# What it does
It uses AI to visually recognize coins from its huge database, giveing relevant descriptions, and allowing us to create a collection, which works with the AI detector.

# How we built it
We built this project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, utilizing NodeJS for the backend, ReactJS for the frontend, and powering it using OpenAI's and SerpAPI's API.

# Challenges we ran into
We ran into multiple challenges, primarily learning API usage through documentation. We had to spend a lot of time on it, but in the end, it worked out.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating this project and still having a good UI is something we are proud of. This project made us delve out of our comfort zone, but we managed to not only learn but ace it and implement it in our project, just as we planned.

# What we learned
We learned to implement AI tools in our projects, which was not only surreal but also the backbone of Coiny.

# What's next for Coiny
We will be looking to substantially increase the features of Coiny, expanding it to more monetary items, providing more descriptive information, and upgrading the collection.

# Built With
 firebase, javascript, html5, css3, react, node.js, openai api, serpapi, google shopping api
